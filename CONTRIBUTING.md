IGNITE is a project to make a solid, fun and practical workshop aimed at training scientists so that they can understand how they can do SciComm and how they can harmonize that with their research. You can read more on our philosophy and aims in our [README](README.md) file, and in our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).
