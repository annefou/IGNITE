## Code of Conduct

If you decide to participate in this project, we assume you agree with the [IGNITE Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [graciellehigino@gmail.com](mailto:graciellehigino@gmail.com).  

## Before you start  

IGNITE is a project to make a solid, fun and practical workshop aimed at training scientists so that they can understand how they can do SciComm and how they can harmonize that with their research. You can read more on our philosophy and aims in our [README](README.md) file, and in our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).  
This is a completly open project, and every contribution made to it is also completly open. Keep that in mind, and let's move foward!
