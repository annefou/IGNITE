### **Project Description:**
We believe that science empowers people, and science communication (SciComm) is a fundamental part of this process. In order for SciComm to be done effectively, we need a joint effort between researchers and communicators, and efficient methods to reach people who are not interested in science, or have incipient scientific literacy.

The main objective of IGNITE - Biomedical Camp is to train biomedical scientists that work in underdeveloped cities to communicate with non-specialists. To achieve this goal, we want to produce a completely adaptable and permanently open to contribution training, composed by three modules of initiation to SciComm: the basics of communication, with concepts and techniques used in all forms of scientific dissemination; street SciComm, with practical experimentation of personal interaction modalities and aimed at interaction with the community; and a flexible module to be defined according to the demand of participants. We will produce courseware and lessons roadmaps in the open, and then provide face-to-face training in a city of easy access, such as São Paulo - Brazil. We will provide a little stipend for participants to attend the event, which is really important for the project to achieve its core principle of knowledge decentralization. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to provide financial support for all participants, so we will distribute this facility based on letters of intention and negotiation with research institutes. We want to engage especially ECRs from biomedical sciences from the countryside of Brazil and nearby countries, as a way to improve scientific literacy in places that are hard to reach.

At the end of the Camp, we expect to have created a strong network of science communicators on biomedicine, and participants will have solid plans to disseminate and decentralize their knowledge in their home cities. After the grant period is finished, we will continuously provide support to participants through online mentoring. We expect at least 30 participants to attend the training, and we want to engage at least three more contributors to help us with the lessons. Furthermore, we expect that our community will grow substantially during the period of the project, as it has been since Mozilla Global Sprint 2018.
