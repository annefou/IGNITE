 ## Por que este projeto existe?  
**Science communication can empower people**. Once we understand how science works, and we learn to tell gossip from trustable facts, we can make better choices and feel secure about them. This is why I believe that SciComm and outreach are so important in our society, because it protects us from manipulation.  
  
Although we have amazing communicators doing their jobs in SciComm, **we need scientists to help us in this mission**. But there is a gap there: scientists are not trained to communicate their work to non-specialists (which can be really hard!), and they often think they can't do it. Also, they feel discouraged to do SciComm because they don't associate it with concrete benefits to their careers.  

> But could we deny ourselves to the crowd and still remain scientists?

SciComm is an interdisciplinary field and this is how this project was born: **why not gather people with different skills to build a comprehensive SciComm workshop aimed at young<sup>[1](#young)</sup> scientists**?

#### Quem sou eu?  
[I am a grad student from Brazil](https://graciellehigino.github.io/) and I've been concerned about SciComm for years. When I was a teenager (already dreaming about being a scientist), I thought that would be great to write about science, and make it fun and accessible. Then I grew up, became a scientist, and now I write and talk about it! But, as most scientists, I was not trained to do it, but fortunately I've met amazing people in my journey who helped me. That's why this project is so important to me!  

## Como vocÃª pode ajudar?  
If you are so excited about the project as I am, you can jump in and help!  

#### Surveying scientists  
The first thing is to know what scientists need to start doing SciComm. What are their main difficulties? What is the SciComm medium they like the most? How could the workshop help them? It would also be interesting to understand how scientists are sticking to SciComm after the workshop.  
To do that, we will elaborate a couple of surveys and collect some data. YAY! ðŸŽ‰  

#### Build the workshop  
The main need is to build a "starter kit" with the main content of the workshop and guidelines to promote one. This kit will be composed by courseware, activites, resources and a simple organizer workflow (see details on [Issues](https://github.com/graciellehigino/IGNITE/issues)).  

#### Bring your ideas!  
Bring your creative ideas to make the whole program even better! We will need a visual identity, a website, to build content, to spread the word, prospect funding, write funding proposals, prospect experts in each field to participate as lecturers, and we could also think about puting up an incentive program to encourage scientists to keep in the SciComm path... Phew!
